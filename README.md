# Suckless Koala
I use a few pieces of suckless software because, although they unfortunately have horrible documentation, most of their software is great. However, I don't use their software where I see their 'patching' method to be unnecessary - e.g. browser; I choose to use Qutebrowser over Surf because I am more comfortable messing around with Python than with C and Qutebrowser is 'suckless' enough for me. Anyway, this repo is where I place my suckless builds.

Any patches applied can be found in a patches folder within the respective application's directory.
