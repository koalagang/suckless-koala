# Suckless Koala
Any patches applied can be found in a patches folder within the respective application's directory.

## dmenu
Patches I'm considering adding but have not yet added:
* center (probably not?)
* fuzzyhighlight
* fuzzymatch
* pipeout

## sxiv

New bindings:
* J - zoom out
* K - zoom in
* L - go to next image
* H - go to previous image
* space - flip image
* p - play gif
* control+h - go to previous gif frame
* control+l - go to next gif frame

At some point I will create a script like [this](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.config/sxiv/exec/key-handler).

## slock

Nothing special. Just a simple lockscreen.

## coming soon...
* dwm
* st? (I'm quite happy with Alacritty but I might try out st)
* ~~surf~~ `Qutebrowser ftw`
